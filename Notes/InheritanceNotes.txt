INHERITANCE:

public class Employee {...}            v base/superclass
public class HourlyEmployee extends Employee {...}
public class SalariedEmployee extends Employee {...}
                ^ subclass       ^ keyword


Everything implicitly uses Inheritance and "extends" Object (if not otherwise stated)



*****Constructors have no return type and the name matched the name of the method!*****


Ex:
public class HourlyEmployee extends Employee {

    public HourlyEmployee(String aName, Date aHireDate) {
        super(aName, aHireDate);  *****calls the superclass*****
    }
}


If not specified, the compiler will call super(); of Object in any constructor.
    (it's hidden, and doesn't do anything)
